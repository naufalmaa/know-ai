## üîß WebSocket Connection Fix Summary

### ‚úÖ Problem Identified and Fixed

**Issue**: The chat service was running on port 9001, but your frontend expects it on port 8000 (as defined in `.env`).

**Root Cause**: Port mismatch between:
- Frontend expectation: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_WS=ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws`
- Chat service actual port: 9001 (incorrect)

### ‚úÖ Actions Taken

1. **Fixed Chat Service Port**: 
   - Updated `services/chat/app.py` to use `CHAT_PORT` environment variable (8000)
   - Restarted chat service on correct port 8000

2. **Fixed Agno Service**:
   - Added missing startup code to `services/agno/main.py`
   - Started Agno service on port 9010

3. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - Added console logging to ChatStream component
   - Better error messages for WebSocket connection issues

### üöÄ Current Status

**Services Running**:
- ‚úÖ **Chat Service**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (WebSocket: `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws`)
- ‚úÖ **Agno Service**: `http://127.0.0.1:9010`

### üß™ How to Test

1. **Restart your frontend** (if it's running):
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   npm run dev  # or pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Check browser console** at `localhost:3000`:
   - Should see: `WebSocket URL: ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws`
   - Should see: `WebSocket connected successfully`

3. **Go to Assistant section**:
   - Button should show "Send" instead of "Connecting..."
   - Type a message and send it
   - You should see Agno enhancements in real-time

### üîç If Still Not Working

**Check Frontend Console** (F12 ‚Üí Console):
- Look for `WebSocket URL:` log - should show `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws`
- Look for connection errors
- If you see "Failed to connect", check if chat service is still running

**Verify Services**:
```bash
# Check if chat service is running
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000

# Check if Agno service is running  
curl http://127.0.0.1:9010/health
```

### üí° Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file has:
```bash
CHAT_PORT=8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_WS=ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws
AGNO_PORT=9010
```

---

**The fix is complete!** Your WebSocket connection should now work properly. Try accessing localhost:3000/assistant and the "Connecting..." issue should be resolved.
